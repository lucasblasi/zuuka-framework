Simplifyify adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).



[v8.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v8.0.0) (2020-02-18)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Moved Simplifyify to the [@JSDevTools scope](https://www.npmjs.com/org/jsdevtools) on NPM

- The "simplifyify" NPM package is now just a wrapper around the scoped "@jsdevtools/simplifyify" package

[v7.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v7.0.0) (2018-10-18)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Breaking Change
- Simplifyify is no longer tested on Node 6 and Node 8.  It's now only tested on the latest LTS version of Node (which is currently Node 10).  It **currently** still works fine in older versions, but they are no longer officially supported.

#### Other Changes
- Improved performance by making many operations async and parallelizing them

- Fixed a bug that caused Simplifyify to crash in watch mode when files contained syntax errors

[v6.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v6.0.0) (2018-09-29)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Breaking Changes
- The shorthand argument for the `--exclude` option is now `-x` instead of `-u`

- The `--test` argument has been replaced with `--coverage` for clarity.  The corresponding shorthand argument is `-c`.

- The `--coverage` argument produces a `.coverage.js` file instead of a `.test.js` file

[v5.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v5.0.0) (2018-09-17)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### TypeScript Support
- Simplifyify now has built-in support for TypeScript!  If your entry file has a `.ts` or `.tsx` extension, then Simplifyify will automatically use [TSify](https://github.com/TypeStrong/tsify/) to transpile your code.  You can configure TSify via the `browserify.plugins` field in your package.json, or via a tsconfig.json file.  If both exist, then the `browserify.plugins` field overrides any values in tsconfig.json.

#### Breaking Changes
- Dropped support for Node v4.0 and older (see https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

- Previously, [browserify-banner](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/browserify-banner) could be configured using the `browserify.transform` field in package.json.  But browserify-banner is a Browserify plugin, not a transform.  This caused it to be loaded twice - once as a plugin and once as a transform.  You should now use the `browserify.plugins` field instead.

- The `browserify.transform` field in package.json can be used to configure Browserify transforms.  Previously, Simplifyify allowed you to _also_ use it to configure Browserify plugins, but that caused plugins to be loaded twice - once as a plugin and once as a transform.  This can cause undefined behavior with some plugins.  To fix that, Simplifyify now expects you to to configure Browserify plugins using the `browserify.plugins` field instead.

[v4.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v4.0.0) (2018-01-17)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated all dependencies, including major version updates of `browserify`, `babelify`, `browserify-istanbul`, and `exorcist`

- Switched from UglifyJS to [Uglify-ES](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-es), which supports ES2015+ syntax.  This _shouldn't_ break anything, but I'm bumping the major version number just to be safe


[Full Changelog](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/compare/v3.3.0...v4.0.0)



[v3.3.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v3.3.0) (2018-01-10)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Refactored to use ES6 syntax (Node 4.x compatible)

- The `--standalone` option now supports a wildcard (e.g. "MyLib.*").  Thanks to [@taye](https://github.com/taye) for [the PR](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/pull/24)


[Full Changelog](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/compare/v3.2.0...v3.3.0)



[v3.2.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v3.2.0) (2016-11-11)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed several subtle bugs that were introduced in 3.1.0


[Full Changelog](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)



[v3.1.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v3.1.0) (2016-11-06)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### New Feature: [bannerify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bannerify) support
Just add a `banner.txt` file to your project, and it'll automatically be added to your output bundle(s). The `banner.txt` file can contain [Lodash templates](https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.6#template), which have access to the full [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.6) library as well as [moment-js](http://momentjs.com/) for date/time formatting.  See [this example](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/blob/master/test/test-apps/hello/banner.txt).

#### Better performance
File i/o operations have been optimized in this release. Files that are likely to be needed by multiple entry files are cached so they only need to be read once.  Other file i/o operations that were previously synchronous are now asynchronous.

[v3.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v3.0.0) (2016-11-02)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Major changes in this release:

##### 1) Dropped support for Node 0.x
Simplifyify now requires Node 4.0 or greater, which is in-line with the [Node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS). Many other dev tools, including some that `simplifyify` depends on, have also started dropping support for Node 0.x.  Time to upgrade, folks.

##### 2) Better minification
Simplifyify has always used [uglifyify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifyify) under the hood to minify each module individually, but now it _also_ uses [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#uglifyjs-2) to minify the entire bundle file. This [2-phase process](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/blob/5ab81a30242b585bee21915fe899714404a4e81a/lib/add-transforms.js#L91-L159) produces the [smallest output possible](https://github.com/hughsk/uglifyify#motivationusage).

##### 3) Configure Uglifyify and Istanbul options
You can now specify custom options for the built-in Uglifyify and Istanbul transforms via the [`browserify.transform`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#browserifytransform) in your `package.json`. See [this example](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify#browserify-transforms) in the ReadMe.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/compare/v2.0.4...v3.0.0)



[v2.0.0](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify/tree/v2.0.0) (2015-12-28)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Major changes in this release:

##### 1) Support for Browserify transforms
Simplifyify will now check your `package.json` file to see if you have a [browserify.transform](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify#browserifytransform) field.  If so, then it will automatically add those transforms.  No need to specify them on the command line.  See [the readme](https://github.com/JS-DevTools/simplifyify#browserify-transforms) for more details.

##### 2) You choose whether the "default" bundle gets created
In previous versions, Simplifyify _always_ created an unminified bundle.  This makes sense if you don't specify _any_ output options.  But if you _do_ specify output options (such as `--coverage` or `--minify`), then you may not have expected it to _also_ create an unminified bundle.  So, in this version, there is now a `--bundle` option that you must use to explicitly specify that you want an unminified bundle.  Otherwise, only the bundle(s) that you explicitly specify will be created.
